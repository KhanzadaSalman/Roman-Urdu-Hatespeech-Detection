Hate Speech Detection in Roman Urdu using DSCNN

Technologies: Python, TensorFlow, NLP

Purpose: Detect hate speech in Roman Urdu, handling informal syntax, code-mixing, and spelling variations.

Dataset: RU-HSD-30K Roman Urdu Hate Speech Dataset
, used in the research paper “Context-Aware Deep Learning Model for Detection of Roman Urdu Hate Speech on Social Media Platform”.

Solution: Developed a Depth-wise Separable CNN (DSCNN) with RomUrEm embeddings and a custom preprocessing pipeline.

Results: Achieved high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, outperforming baseline models while being computationally efficient.
